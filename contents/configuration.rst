Command line options for swarm
====================================

The ``swarm`` executable supports the following configuration options:

* Configuration file
* Environment variables
* Command line

Options provided via command line override options from the environment variables, which will override options in the config file. If an option is not explicitly provided, a default will be chosen.

In order to keep the set of flags and variables manageable, only a subset of all available configuration options are available via command line and environment variables. Some are only available through a TOML configuration file.

.. note:: Swarm reuses code from ethereum, specifically some p2p networking protocol and other common parts. To this end, it accepts a number of environment variables which are actually from the ``geth`` environment. Refer to the geth documentation for reference on these flags.

This is the list of flags inherited from ``geth``:

.. code-block:: none

  --identity
  --bootnodes
  --datadir
  --keystore
  --port
  --nodiscover
  --v5disc
  --netrestrict
  --nodekey
  --nodekeyhex
  --maxpeers
  --nat
  --ipcdisable
  --ipcpath
  --password

Config File
=============

.. note:: ``swarm`` can be executed with the ``dumpconfig`` command, which prints a default configuration to STDOUT, and thus can be redirected to a file as a template for the config file.

A TOML configuration file is organized in sections. The below list of available configuration options is organized according to these sections. The sections correspond to `Go` modules, so need to be respected in order for file configuration to work properly. See `<https://github.com/naoina/toml>`_ for the TOML parser and encoder library for Golang, and `<https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>`_ for further information on TOML.

To run Swarm with a config file, use:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ swarm --config /path/to/config/file.toml
