Manifests in Swarm
----------------------

In general manifests declare a list of strings associated with swarm hashes. A manifest matches to exactly one hash, and it consists of a list of entries declaring the content which can be retrieved through that hash. Let us begin with an introductory example.


This is demonstrated by the following example.
Let's create a directory containing the two orange papers and an html index file listing the two pdf documents.

.. code-block:: none

  $ ls -1 orange-papers/
  index.html
  smash.pdf
  sw^3.pdf

  $ cat orange-papers/index.html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
    </head>
    <body>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="./sw^3.pdf">Viktor Trón, Aron Fischer, Dániel Nagy A and Zsolt Felföldi, Nick Johnson: swap, swear and swindle: incentive system for swarm.</a>  May 2016
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="./smash.pdf">Viktor Trón, Aron Fischer, Nick Johnson: smash-proof: auditable storage for swarm secured by masked audit secret hash.</a> May 2016
        </li>
      </ul>
    </body>
  </html>

We now use the ``swarm up`` command to upload the directory to swarm to create a mini virtual site.

.. code-block:: none

  swarm --recursive --defaultpath orange-papers/index.html --bzzapi http://swarm-gateways.net/ up orange-papers/ 2> up.log
  > 2477cc8584cc61091b5cc084cdcdb45bf3c6210c263b0143f030cf7d750e894d

The returned hash is the hash of the manifest for the uploaded content (the orange-papers directory):

We now can get the manifest itself directly (instead of the files they refer to) by using the bzz-raw protocol ``bzz-raw``:

.. code-block:: none

  wget -O - "http://localhost:8500/bzz-raw:/2477cc8584cc61091b5cc084cdcdb45bf3c6210c263b0143f030cf7d750e894d"

  > {
    "entries": [
      {
        "hash": "4b3a73e43ae5481960a5296a08aaae9cf466c9d5427e1eaa3b15f600373a048d",
        "contentType": "text/html; charset=utf-8"
      },
      {
        "hash": "4b3a73e43ae5481960a5296a08aaae9cf466c9d5427e1eaa3b15f600373a048d",
        "contentType": "text/html; charset=utf-8",
        "path": "index.html"
      },
      {
        "hash": "69b0a42a93825ac0407a8b0f47ccdd7655c569e80e92f3e9c63c28645df3e039",
        "contentType": "application/pdf",
        "path": "smash.pdf"
      },
      {
        "hash": "6a18222637cafb4ce692fa11df886a03e6d5e63432c53cbf7846970aa3e6fdf5",
        "contentType": "application/pdf",
        "path": "sw^3.pdf"
      }
    ]
  }


Manifests contain content_type information for the hashes they reference. In other contexts, where content_type is not supplied or, when you suspect the information is wrong, it is possible to specify the content_type manually in the search query. For example, the manifest itself should be `text/plain`:

.. code-block:: none

   http://localhost:8500/bzz-raw:/2477cc8584cc61091b5cc084cdcdb45bf3c6210c263b0143f030cf7d750e894d?content_type="text/plain"

Now you can also check that the manifest hash matches the content (in fact swarm does it for you):

.. code-block:: none

   $ wget -O- http://localhost:8500/bzz-raw:/2477cc8584cc61091b5cc084cdcdb45bf3c6210c263b0143f030cf7d750e894d?content_type="text/plain" > manifest.json

   $ swarm hash manifest.json
   > 2477cc8584cc61091b5cc084cdcdb45bf3c6210c263b0143f030cf7d750e894d

Path Matching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A useful feature of manifests is that we can match paths with URLs.
In some sense this makes the manifest a routing table and so the manifest acts as if it was a host.

More concretely, continuing in our example, when we request:

.. code-block:: none

  GET http://localhost:8500/bzz:/2477cc8584cc61091b5cc084cdcdb45bf3c6210c263b0143f030cf7d750e894d/sw^3.pdf

Swarm first retrieves the document matching the manifest above. The url path ``sw^3`` is then matched against the entries. In this case a perfect match is found and the document at 6a182226... is served as a pdf.

As you can see the manifest contains 4 entries, although our directory contained only 3. The extra entry is there because of the ``--defaultpath orange-papers/index.html`` option to ``swarm up``, which associates the empty path with the file you give as its argument. This makes it possible to have a default page served when the url path is empty.
This feature essentially implements the most common webserver rewrite rules used to set the landing page of a site served when the url only contains the domain. So when you request

.. code-block:: none

  GET http://localhost:8500/bzz:/2477cc8584cc61091b5cc084cdcdb45bf3c6210c263b0143f030cf7d750e894d/

you get served the index page (with content type ``text/html``) at ``4b3a73e43ae5481960a5296a08aaae9cf466c9d5427e1eaa3b15f600373a048d``.
